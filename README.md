## YoutubeEDURate

EDUrate is a simple chrome browser extension that interfaces directly with your Youtube.com content feed in order to inject accurate ratings (0%-100%) on the educational value of the content you are being shown. Inspiration for this project came from our love for the immmense learning potential of YouTube, but great distaste for the constant distractions that suggested  uneducational videos are from the learning workflow. 

EDUrate calls upon a custom library of over 8,000 highly-educational words, words that are used to analyze a video's potential for learning. EDUrate also scrapes through a video's linked directory to find and evaluate the content-category (i.e. Educational, Entertainment, Sports) and build a rating from there... Future adaptations of EDUrate will use machine learning algorithms to discover the nuances of video titles which indicate their intellectual value to a user.

Potential Applications: 
  - Deployed by School Administrators, along with simple Javascript interpretations that block content which does not reach a       certain educational percentage: Keeping students undistracted, and freeing them to learn.
  - Deployed by work / office management in order to encourage productive unencumbered YouTube learning.
  - Deployed by independent creators, builders, and learners to limit personal distraction and encourage thorough learning.
  
  
  
EDUrate solves a small fraction of the problem of media distraction in our modern online age. Little strides to further productivity and online education-first values
